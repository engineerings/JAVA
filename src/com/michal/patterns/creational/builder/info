# Builder

# Concepts
- Handles complex constructors
- Large number of parameters
- Immutability

ex: "StringBuilder"

# Design
- Flexibility over telescoping constructors
- Static inner class
- calls appropriate constructor
- Negates the need for exposed setters

# info
- Objects crated are immutable
- Pattern has a static inner class
- Designed first
- Add complexity
- Handles complex constructors
- No interface required
- Can be a separated class
- Work with legacy code
